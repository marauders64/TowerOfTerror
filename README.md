# TowerOfTerror
A battle royale simulator designed for the ambitious at heart.

# Instructions
Move using the WASD or Keys.  
Attack using the Space Bar.

# Work Completed
* Cheat mode functional. Click on the empty space between the last button and the "Name" textBox. Activating cheat mode turns the Start Game button yellow. But be warned: cheating will profit you nothing. Literally. 
* Pre-game screens functional
* Gameplay fairly smooth
* Full animation added
* Sound effect functional
* Items functional and active
* Endgame functional
* Save/Load functional
* Unit testing for most aspects

# Major Issues
* Defense powerups, if used enough, can make the player invincible
